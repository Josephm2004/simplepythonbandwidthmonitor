This is a very simple python script I made to be able to see my bandwidth traffic without having to use top or another utility

This monitor was made for the sole purpose of me wanting to learn more about the uses of psutil and to further my knowledge of python

To use with your system you may have to change the ACTIVE_INTERFACE = "insert your active interface"
You can find this by using "ip route" in your terminal

This monitor is not going to show specific processes it will only provide you with total network traffic currently accross your active interface.
